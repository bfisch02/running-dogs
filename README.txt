I have created index.html and omfgdogs.css to mimik omfgdogs.com without using flash.

I spent approximately three hours working on this assignment (most of the time was spent
learning how to create a key for secure communications between my computer and GitHub).

I did not collaborate with any Comp20 students, though I did require a bit of help from
my suitemate, who has experience working with GitHub and knew how to explain keys in a
direct way.
